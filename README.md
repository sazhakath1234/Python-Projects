Python Projects Repository
Welcome to my Python projects repository! This collection includes a variety of Python scripts and projects, demonstrating my growth and hands-on experience with programming, automation, data analysis, and problem-solving. These projects leverage different libraries and tools to automate tasks, extract insights, and build solutions to real-world challenges.

Overview:
Since the release of ChatGPT, I’ve spent considerable time exploring prompt engineering and leveraging AI to bridge gaps in my Python skill set. With the assistance of AI tools, I’ve developed several Python projects, many of which have become integral to my work, such as the Tableau Workbook Documentation Script. These projects not only showcase my coding ability but also reflect my continuous learning and practical application of Python.



Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language used for all projects.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
OpenPyXL: For working with Excel files.
Requests: For API integrations.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping (if applicable).
ChatGPT: Leveraged for prompt engineering and assistance in Python development.



Features:
Automation: Several scripts automate tedious or repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
Data Handling: Projects demonstrate the ability to manipulate and analyze data, such as cleaning data, generating reports, and integrating with external APIs.
Practical Use Cases: Projects like the Tableau Workbook Documentation Script reflect real-world applications of Python in the workplace.
AI-Assisted Development: Some scripts were developed with the help of AI tools to overcome challenges in coding and expedite the learning process.



How to Use:
Clone or Download the Repository: Clone or download the repository to your local machine to access the Python scripts.
Set Up Dependencies: Install any necessary Python libraries using pip (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt).
Run the Scripts: Open the Python files in your IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) and run the scripts locally to see them in action.
Adapt for Your Needs: Feel free to adapt these scripts for your own use or modify them to better fit your project requirements.
